    <h1>HTML-Attributes</h1>
    <p>HTML forms are used to take the data from the user and give it to the server file.</p>

    <h2>Attributes Of Form:</h2>
    <h4>Value</h4>
    <p>The input value attribute gives the initial value for the input field.</p>
    <h4>Readonly</h4>
    <p>Readonly value means that particular value in the input which is initially given or not given won't be edited by the user, it is in the form of Read-Only only. That value would be submitted, but can't be edited by the user.</p>
    <h4>Disabled</h4>
    <p>Unlike the Read-Only condition, this particular input will be disabled by default and no value can be entered in it, and this value won't even been submitted in the server. It's just completely Disabled.</p>
    <h4>Size</h4>
    <p>This size attribute specifies the visible length of the input tag and how much size would be displayed on the box, the box can take as many characters, but would only display the size defined way.</p>
    <h4>MaxLength</h4>
    <p>The maxlength attribute is used in the input tags, so that it can only take the maxlength specified amount of characters in the input, and not more than that, we can specify the javascript for that condition too in script.</p>
    <h4>Pattern</h4>
    <p>Pattern attribute is used to create the pattern in the input method, so that the specific pattern must be followed in the sense to submit that input, like that in the passwords and like that. And it is classified as <code> pattern="[A-Za-z]{3}</code> <i>Here this code means that this pattern will only take characters from [A-Z] & [a-z], and this must be 3 words in it.</i></p>
    <h4>Placeholder</h4>
    <p>Placeholder specifies the thing written in the output box, and when something is typed in it, it will go blank and just the written thing itself. <i>[Its like the guide in the input box, like what to write and how to write in it.]</i></p>
    <h4>Min & Max</h4>
    <p>Min and Max are used in the cases where you have to give the specific range in the numbers, like in input:number or input:range in the form, where specific range is defined in it.</p>
